<h1> Deliverable Automation Tool (DAT) </h1>
<p> DAT is a tool whose intention is to reduce the time it takes to generate deliverables. Bearing this in mind, the architect initially goes through a stage of creating meta-models, which in the case of this project, they will be used to create business models in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets' files, which are represented in catalogs, matrices, diagrams, text or images. Up to this point, the process continues to be the same as the standard and just at this moment the user uses DAT to generate the deliverable with the aforementioned artifacts as input. </p>
